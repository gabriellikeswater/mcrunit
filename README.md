# 🏃 Run It

A Well-Documented Program to run your Minecraft Java Server & Python Discord Bot with Style!

## 🌍 How to add run it to your server

1- Make sure to rename the (api).jar file in your server's folder to a more simple name. (Eg. "arclight-forge-1.19.3-1.0.2.jar" -> "arclight.jar")

2- If you have a python discord bot, rename the .py file to dbot.py and add it to your server's folder. (Eg. "main.py" -> "dbot.py")

3- If you want to use the playit proxy change the .exe file in your server's folder to playit.exe. (Eg. "playit-0.9.3-signed.exe" -> "playit.exe")

4- Add runit to the main folder of your server.

5- You're done! Now, whenever you're going to start your server, just open the newly installed runit program!
