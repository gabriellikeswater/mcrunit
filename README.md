# üèÉ MCrunit

A Lightweight, Well-Documented Program to run your Minecraft Java Server & Python Discord Bot with Style!

## üåç How to add MCrunit to your server

1 - First you'll need to make sure you have a server. You can see how to make one here: https://telegra.ph/MCrunit-09-13-2

1 - Make sure to rename the (server software).jar file in your server's folder to a more simple name so you remember. (Eg. "arclight-forge-1.19.3-1.0.2.jar" -> "arclight.jar")
   You can find a list of server software, here: https://telegra.ph/MCrunit-09-13

2 - If you have a Python Discord bot, rename the .py file to dbot.py and add it to your server's folder. (Eg. "main.py" -> "dbot.py")

3 - If you want to use the Playit.gg proxy change the .exe file in your server's folder to playit.exe. (Eg. "playit-0.9.3-signed.exe" -> "playit.exe")

4 - Add MCrunit to the main folder of your server.

5 - You're done! Now, whenever you're going to start your server, just open the newly installed mcrunit program!

6 - If you run into any problems just send us an Issue request on our Github page's "Issues"
    section and we'll try to help you out as fast as possible. This could mean you indirectly
    contributed to our program's code so It won't happen again to others, thank you!!

## üì∂ What is "Playit.gg"?

Playit.gg is a global proxy that allows anyone to host a videogame server without port forwarding by using tunneling, including minecraft. Only the server needs to run the program, not every player. Learn more at https://playit.gg

IMPORTANT! - MCrunit is NOT associated with Playit, go support them!

## ‚ùì How it works

MCrunit works by reading the files in the server's folder and opening the server files within the program as well as a python discord bot and playit proxy (not within the program), via user input commands. It is one of my goals to make the user interface as simple, clean and awesome as possible. I will personally then take notes of any issues you tell me about to improve the program. (as well as all my other projects)
