# run it

A Well-Documented Program to run your Minecraft Java Server & Python Discord Bot with Style!

## How to add run it to your server

1- Choose the right version of run it for your server. (eg. if you have a spigot server choose the spigot version. More info below.)

2- Whatever version you choose, make sure to rename the (api).jar file in your server's folder to the one in the version you downloaded. (Eg. "arclight-forge-1.19.3-1.0.2.jar" -> "arclight.jar")

3- If you choose a version that also runs your python discord bot, rename the .py to dbot.py.

4- Add the program to the main folder of your server.

5- Your done! Now, whenever you're going to start your server, just open the newly installed run it program!

## How to choose a version

The run it program is distributed in various versions, to help fit your needs!

Each version's name is divided in Gigabyte allocation (eg. 4G), API (eg. spigot), whether you use the playit proxy or not and if you want to run your discord bot alongside the mc server.
